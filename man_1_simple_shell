.SH EXIT STATUS
Errors that are detected by the program, such as syntax error will make the program exit with a non-zero exit status. In non interactive the program doesn't display the error and just return the status. If we use exit command to stop the program, it will return the status of the last command used. There is no option to display all the error of all past command.
